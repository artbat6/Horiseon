Title: Outsourced SEO refactoring for SEO company (Horiseon)

Description:
Horiseon, a SEO company, has requested to have someone else improve their website's SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and accessability for the visually impaired.  In order to do so we have added meta keywords and given descriptions to all of the website's images.  The website is unchanged visually, only the underlying HTML and CSS has been affected.
